```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Getting started

1. Open your package's `.Rproj` file
2. Run `usethis::use_pkgdown()` once to configure. This will generate additional files and sub-folders (e.g. `docs`).
3. Run `pkgdown::build_site()` to preview site and before any push to GitHub. There will be a lot of ancillary files, but check them in. They're all necessary for GitHub to build the website.

Any .Rmd in the `vignette` sub-folder will be automatically converted to an article.

## Activate GitHub Pages:

1. Navigate in GitHub to `Settings` > `Pages`
2. Set the GitHub Pages Source to `main` branch & the sub-folder `docs`

It may take anywhere from 5 mins to 20 mins to see the website.
